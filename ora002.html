    <strong>Database Performance Improvements</strong>
</p>
<p>
    Reducing the number of database SQL query calls
</p>
<p>
    In this post, we will look at reducing the amount of queries in the
    database in the first place, reducing the number of calls and decreasing
    the volume of data coming and going (Network load).
</p>
<p>
    In the database call and performance above, call is called through the
    application for convenience, but the type of call is technically different.
</p>
<p>
    • Parse Call: Call to request SQL parsing • Execute call: Call to execute
    SQL calls • Fetch call: The result of a SELECT statement that requests data
    transfer
</p>
<p>
    • User call: Call through Application (external) calls • Recursive call:
    Call that occurs inside the DBMS (data dictionary lookup for SQL parsing
    and optimization, user-defined functions, performing SQL within the
    procedure)
</p>
<p>
    You just have to note that call is not divided by the same classification
    criteria. (the kind of call varies)
</p>
<p>
    This post is a light-hearted point of view of performance improvement, and
    we'll look at some of the ways to improve user call.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>1. Using one SQL</strong>
</p>
<p>
    It's easy to learn how to improve your SQL tuning so that you can load the
    same data into 1 SQL rather than hitting a loop in a program 100,000 times,
    one million times, or more SQL queries.
</p>
<p>
    Or, the SQL query is called one time, but the query that fetches the same
    table several times internally requires tuning.
</p>
<p>
    For example, suppose you want to (1) view (SELECT) which table (ex. The
    number of records viewed is 100,000) (2) and insert it into another table
    by filtering from the records you viewed.
</p>
<p>
    Then it would have been 100,000 times, and the fetch call was 100k times
    for the lookup of 100,000 cases, and the parse call and execute call were
    less than 100,000 or (more than the number of insert inquiries).
</p>
<p>
    This would result in a total of more than 300,000 calls to be addressed in
    a single SQL call (parse call, execute call).
</p>
<p>
    For example, let's say you need five calls to do one job. If you change the
    number of calls that require 5 calls to one call at a time, there is a
    five-fold performance improvement when you simply calculate the operation
    24 hours a day.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>2. Using Array Processing</strong>
</p>
<p>
    This is the concept of batch collecting, rather than insert/update/delete
    in the code, when working with large amounts.
</p>
<p>
    Note that a series of processes must be carried out in all array units.
</p>
<p>
    What I'm saying is that fetch is an array, and the next step is to handle
    the insert and vice versa. (All tasks should be placed to maximize the
    effect)
</p>
<p>
    (Check the interface of the development language!)
</p>
<p>
    <strong>3. Minimize Fetch Call</strong>
</p>
<p>
    A DBMS cannot send a large volume of records to a client at once.
</p>
<p>
    Therefore, it is possible to reduce the fetch call in this way to transfer
    a certain amount by dividing.
</p>
<p>
    In Oracle, you can adjust a certain amount of units through the ArraySize
    or fetchsize settings.
</p>
<p>
    For example, if ArraySize is set to 100 and you read 30,000 records, fetch
    call will occur at 301.
</p>
<p>
    OLTP is a good practice when you have a lot of query results (records), but
    you only want to fetch some of them.
</p>
<p>
    (This is referred to as partial-scope processing, because the user does not
    read all tens of thousands of cases)
</p>
<p>
    Note that the DBMS does not have any performance improvements when it is
    programmed in such a way that partial-scope processing requires that all
    values be fetched and processed by the developer.
</p>
<p>
    Ultimately, the point is that you need to adjust the arraysize accordingly
    to the amount of data that needs to be transmitted over the network.
</p>
<p>
    -If you need to get all your data, it is better to arraysize. Although the
    amount is intact, the number of fetch call decreases.
</p>
<p>
    -If you need only a small fraction of the data in front of it, it is better
    to arraysize.
</p>
<p>
    Increasing the arraysize reduces network load and also reduces the number
    of blocks that the server process should read.
</p>
<p>
    The reason is that there are 10 records in one block, and two blocks, that
    is, 20 records, when you need to read all 20 records, if ArraySize is 3,
    block I/O occurs eight times, fetch call takes place seven times.
</p>
<p>
    If ArraySize is 5, the block I/O occurs four times and fetch call also
    happens four times.
</p>
<p>
    However, ArraySize is not a good thing to raise. ArraySize and call numbers
    are inversely proportional (?) , so test and use it properly.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>4. Use of page processing</strong>
</p>
<p>
    Improving performance with partial-scope processing is only possible in the
    development environment of expressions that fetch only when the user
    explicitly requests without closing the cursor.
</p>
<p>
    In a Web application environment that does not persist connections with the
    database, it is not possible to keep the cursor open and handle the
    processing of an expression that performs an individual SQL statement
    whenever the user requests the next page.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>
        5. Adult a distributed query, filtering only minimal data when remote
        joins
    </strong>
</p>
<p>
    If you have created a distributed database system, you may need to send and
    join tables in the remote.
</p>
<p>
    If there are 500,000 records in the table that should be joined, the
    network load will be sent and received for 500,000.
</p>
<p>
    This will also result in poor query performance, so you should use a query
    to split the required parts.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>
        6. Use user-defined functions, procedure only when absolutely necessary
    </strong>
</p>
<p>
    User-defined functions and procedure that are performed inside a DBMS are
    not fully compiled as Native code, like intrinsic functions, and run on
    separate engines such as virtual machines.
</p>
<p>
    This causes the context switching to occur each time it runs, which
    degrades performance compared to intrinsic functions.
</p>
<p>
    Additionally, a user-defined function with another built-in query statement
    falls further.
</p>
<p>
    Instead of recommending the end of the writing, you should find a suitable
    time.
</p>
<p>
    When appropriate, it is time to call a small amount and perform a large
    amount of SQL from the inside.
